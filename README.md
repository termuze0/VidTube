# Video Sharing Platform

## Overview
Develop a video sharing platform that allows users to upload, share, comment on, and categorize videos. The platform will include features like user authentication, video recommendations, and advanced search functionalities.

## Aim
The primary aim of this project is to practice and apply various data structures and algorithms (DSA) in a real-world scenario. By building this platform, you'll gain hands-on experience in:
- Efficient data management
- Algorithm design for recommendations and search
- Optimizing performance through appropriate data structures

## Core Features

### 1. User Authentication
- **Functionality:** User registration and login.
- **Data Structure:** Hash table for securely storing user credentials.

### 2. Video Uploading and Management
- **Functionality:** Users can upload videos with titles, descriptions, and tags.
- **Data Structure:** Linked list to manage uploaded videos for easy access.

### 3. Video Categorization
- **Functionality:** Organize videos into categories (e.g., education, entertainment).
- **Data Structure:** Binary search tree (BST) or trie for efficient categorization.

### 4. Search Functionality
- **Functionality:** Users can search for videos by title or tags.
- **Data Structure:** Trie for efficient searching.

### 5. Video Recommendations
- **Functionality:** Recommend videos based on user preferences and viewing history.
- **Data Structure:** Graph to represent user-video interactions and collaborative filtering algorithms.

### 6. Comments and Ratings
- **Functionality:** Users can comment on videos and rate them (like/dislike).
- **Data Structure:** Max heap to manage and display top-rated videos.

### 7. User Subscriptions
- **Functionality:** Users can subscribe to channels.
- **Data Structure:** Hash map to track subscribers and channels.

### 8. Playlist Creation
- **Functionality:** Users can create and manage playlists.
- **Data Structure:** Doubly linked list for easy addition/removal of videos.

### 9. Notifications
- **Functionality:** Notify users about new uploads and replies.
- **Data Structure:** Priority queue to manage notifications based on importance.

### 10. Data Persistence
- **Functionality:** Store user data, videos, and comments.
- **Database Options:**  MongoDB.

## Technologies to Use
- **Frontend:** React for a dynamic user interface.
- **Backend:**   Django for API development.
- **Database:**   MongoDB for data storage.
- **Cloud Storage:** AWS  for storing video files.

## Data Structures and Algorithms Covered
- **Hash Tables:** For user authentication and video management.
- **Linked Lists:** For managing uploaded videos and playlists.
- **Binary Search Trees / Tries:** For categorizing and retrieving videos.
- **Graphs:** For user-video interactions and recommendations.
- **Max Heaps:** For managing top-rated videos.
- **Priority Queues:** For notifications management.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Design the Database Schema:** Create tables for users, videos, comments, and subscriptions.
2. **Develop the Backend:** Build APIs for video uploads, user management, and comments.
3. **Build the Frontend:** Create user interfaces for video browsing, uploading, and commenting.
4. **Implement Core Features:** Develop and test each feature iteratively.
5. **Optimize Performance:** Use appropriate data structures for efficient search and recommendations.
6. **Testing:** Conduct thorough unit and integration tests.
7. **Deployment:** Deploy the application on platforms like Heroku or AWS.

## Conclusion
This project provides a hands-on experience with various data structures and algorithms while creating a functional video-sharing platform. It combines practical development skills with theoretical concepts in computer science.
